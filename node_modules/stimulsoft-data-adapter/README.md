### Installation and running
Use npm to install requred modules:

```bash
npm install
```
Run:
```bash
node index
```
Then, in your code, you should specify the host and port.

index.html
```js
StiOptions.WebServer.url = "http://localhost:9615";
```

In the app.js file, you can change all parameters passed from the JS client-side.

A [sample](https://github.com/stimulsoft/Samples-JS/tree/master/Node.js/Starting%20SQL%20adapters%20from%20the%20HTTP%20server) shows how to run an adapter.
